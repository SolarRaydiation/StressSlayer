# Stress Slayer
*Stress Slayer* is an undergraduate game thesis developed by Ray Rafael S. Abenido under thesis advidsers Maria Mercedes T. Rodrigo and Dan Mark T. Restoles at the Ateneo De Manila University. The goal of this game is to look into the possibility of using games to educate players about stress and stress education by developing a educational mobile game.

The mobile game was developed using Unity 2022.3.9f1 with its Android Build module installed. The contents and mechanics of the game are loosely based on the educational content of the video modules of the [Lusog-Isip Kabataan Education](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLhL2qGJcB4UIxzo0paIdAoIUxHv0bF1f), a series of videos dedicated to teaching viewers (primarily highschool aged students, though applicable to all age brackets) about mental health. However, to reduce the complexity of the game, only the first two video modules were included.

The effectiveness of the game was tested using a modified [GUESS-18 survey](https://uxpajournal.org/validation-game-user-experience-satisfaction-scale-guess/) developed by Keebler et. al. to test how user satisfaction and game engagement test. Additionally, pre-test and post-tests were performed to determine if players learned something while playing the game.

GUESS-18 scores indicated taht the game had a high engagement with players, with a median of 40 out of the max score of 49. Meanwhile, the paired t=test, a statistical technique to compare pre-test and post-test scores, reported that players' knowledge of stress and stress management increased after playing the game. Thus, the idea of using games to educate players about stress and stress management has been proven viable.

## Installation
An APK of the game is provided in this repo. Simply transfer the game to Android 10 or above, open your phone's folder app, locate the APK, then install it. You may need to configure your phone settings to install apps from unknown sources.

**Note:** During early testing, a bug emerged where the game visuals was not being displayed correctly on older Android screens. Despite the best efforts of the developer, the source of the bug could not be found. However, the developer suspects the issue may have something to do with the game being incompatible with older versions of Android or Unity failing to properly building the APK for the game.

## Future Work
This game is considered complete, as the thesis study this game is a part of is also complete.
